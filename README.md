## About The Project

![Banner images][banner-image]
In Virtual Reality (VR), rendering realistic forces is crucial for immersion, but traditional vibrotactile feedback fails to convey force sensations effectively. Studies of asymmetric vibrations that elicit pseudo forces show promise but are inherently tied to unwanted vibrations, reducing realism. Leveraging sensory attenuation to reduce the perceived intensity of self-generated vibrations during user movement, we present a novel algorithm that couples asymmetric vibrations with user motion, which mimics self-generated sensations. Our psychophysics study with 12 participants shows that motion-coupled asymmetric vibration attenuates the experience of vibration (equivalent to a \textasciitilde 30\% reduction in vibration-amplitude) while preserving the experience of force, compared to continuous asymmetric vibrations (state-of-the-art). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in VR through three scenarios: shooting arrows, lifting weights, and simulating haptic magnets. Results revealed that participants preferred forces elicited by motion-coupled asymmetric vibration for tasks like shooting arrows and lifting weights. This research highlights the potential of motion-coupled asymmetric vibrations, offers new insights into sensory attenuation, and advances force rendering in VR.

### Built With

* [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Getting Started

Download the code from the GitHub website or clone repo using your favorite git-client software or with the following command:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sensint/HapticGasPedal.git
   ```
- To run the processing script (Targetting_Task.pde) as is, please add all the trajectories in the same folder as the processing file.
- Assign the right port for the serial communication.
- Run the script


### Firmware

We provide the firmware for one build system - Teensyduino (based on Arduino IDE).

The firmware was tested with the following microcontrollers:

- Teensy 4.1



#### Teensyduino

The easiest way to get up and running with the firmware is Teensyduino.

##### Prerequisites

Download and install the [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) software for your operating system. All needed libraries are included in the basic installation.


### Hardware

This project is based on the Teensy microcontroller and the [PT8211 Audio Kit](https://www.pjrc.com/store/pt8211_kit.html). For understanding the hardware and the underlying principles, please refer to [Haptic Servos](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3544548.3580716).
